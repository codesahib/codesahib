# Hi, I'm Gursahib! 👋


I'm a current graduate student at University of Waterloo.
I have 2+ year of industry experience working as Senior Member of Technical Staff at Siemens EDA.
During my leasure time, I try to sleep well. That's it! :sweat_smile:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Software testing and Web Development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Any small scale software project.
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn works best or email.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I talk a lot. Even if on a deadline. But I still manage to get through that. That's my superpower!! :laughing:
